 Brief description:
 Covers Kan extensions, enriched homotopy theory, homotopy limits and colimits, model categories (including reedy structure) and an introduction to quasi-categories.
- [2020-09-11 Fri] Left off at chapter 5, we have yet to see examples of this bar construction version of things in practice.

- Also need to finish reading paper on the nilpotence theorem
- Lurie 252x notes + reread of the orange book at some point is probably in order

** Model Categories of Spectra                                        :ALTOP:
- Left off at chapter 1 Symmetric Spectra by Schwede
- A read of Mandell-May-Shipley-Schwede is in order at some point

* Ideas to mess around with 
** What is a residue field for Balmer Spectra?
- Want some maybe Verdier localisation K \to k_p such that the pushout along any map K \to L gives you the preimage of p \in Spc(K) in Spc(L). Doing this infinity categorically with some weird Grothendieck construction might get you fibers? Seems like what you're asking for here would be a homotopy limit and so what you could get is the fiber in some fibrant replacement of your infinity category. Things to read up on:
  * Joyal model structure (might just be worthwhile to go bloody read HTT)
  * Infinity categorical Verdier and Bousfield localisation (Nikolaus-Scholze will point to references, Blumberg-Gepner-Tabuada)

** Dogra rule in Kashmir
- A.G. Noorani Article "It was the tendency of Kashmiri Pundits, when in trouble in Kashmir, to look to India for the preservation of religiously conceptualized interests that earned them the honor of being secular nationalists... by contrast, Kashmiri Muslims' demand for a similar protection of rights, denied to them by both a Hindu Dogra and a 'secular' Indian state, has been all too easily misread as engaging in the politics of religious fundamentalism.
