\section{RiehlNotes}
\label{sec:orge8ff365}
\subsection{Part I. Derived Functors and Homotopy Colimits}
\label{sec:orgac79b58}
\subsubsection{Chapter 1}
\label{sec:org93d23d1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Left Kan extension formula in locally small case
\label{sec:org61aedd0}
In the case where \(\mathcal{E}\) is locally small we can deduce the left Kan extension formula via the following sequence of manipulations 

\[
\mathcal{E}\left(\int\limits^{c \in \mathcal{C}} \mathcal{D}(Kc,-)\cdot Fc, G(-)\right) = \int\limits_{c \in \mathcal{C}} Set^{\mathcal{D}}(\mathcal{D}(Kc, -), \mathcal{E}(F(c),G(-))) = \int\limits_{c \in \mathcal{C}}\mathcal{E}(Fc,GKc) = \text{Nat}(F,GK)  
\]

You've got a sort of generalization of realization-nerve here, where if you consider for \(h^{A}: \mathcal{C} \to Set\) the Yoneda embedding and \(F:\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}\) some functor, the expression: 

\[
\text{Lan}_{h^{A}}F(G) = \int\limits^{c\in \mathcal{C}} Set^{\mathcal{C}}(h^{A}(c),G) \cdot Fc = \int\limits^{c\in\mathcal{C}} Gc \cdot Fc 
\]

Which you'll notice reduces straight down to the case of realization of some simplicial object in \(\mathcal{E}\) against the cosimplicial object given by \(F\) for \(\mathcal{C} = \Delta\), which is by definition of the Kan extension supposed to be an adjoint to the singular complex.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Chapter 3}
\label{sec:org90c14cc}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Exercise 3.4.13
\label{sec:org6647d13}
Confused about why this isn't redundant? I went about this by just considering the obvious natural transform \[\mathcal{D}_{0}(x, -) \to \mathcal{V}(\ast,\underline{\mathcal{D}}(x,-))\]

Given by the identity element \(id: \ast \to \underline{\mathcal{D}}(x,x)\)
But I keep running into the implicit assumption that all morphisms from \(\ast\) to your hom object are in correspondence with actual arrows, and I don't know where in the assumptions themselves this is supposed to lie. 

Oh this is basically exactly by definition: the morphisms of the underlying category are exactly given by these maps it's all good. How dumb. We have access to all the possible maps so it's good.

\item Exercise 3.7.18
\label{sec:orga936a8d}
Just do the simplicial enrichment the same way it works for sSet, except the copower becomes the internal hom: i.e. the tensor is exactly what she says, and the internal hom is \[\mathcal{M}^{\Delta^{op}}(F\cdot\Delta[\cdot], G)\] as an sSet: if you think about it, the map from any tensor with an sSet into another object is just picking out maps indexed over the n-simplices into maps from F tensored with one n-simplex. Just think about it it's not hard. For cosimplicial objects just dualise everything, i.e. double-op.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Chapter 4}
\label{sec:orgb7f3352}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Exercise 4.1.8
\label{sec:org60b6a1b}
We unpack the functor tensor product to be

\[
\text{coeq}\left(\coprod_{f:[n] \to [m]} \Delta [n] \times X_{[m]}\right) \xrightarrow[f^{\star}]{f_{\star}} \text{coeq}\left(\coprod_{n} \Delta [n] \times X_{[n]}\right)
\]


We arrive at the following diagram:

\begin{tikzcd}
\Delta(-,n) \times X^{[m]} \arrow[d, "id \times f^{\ast}"] \arrow[r, "f_{\ast} \times id"] &  \Delta(-,m) \times X^{[m]} \\
\Delta(-,n) \times X^{[n]}                                                                 &                              
\end{tikzcd} 

Okay so it turns out this is supposed to be the diagonal? goerssSimplicialHomotopyTheory Exercise 4.1.6 apparently. 

The exercise itself appends \(\gamma: \coprod \Delta[n] \times X_{[n]} \to d(X)\) on r-simplices via:

\[
\gamma_{n}(\tau:[r] \to [n], \ x) = \tau^{*}(x)
\]

And asks to show that the whole thing is a coequalizer. Okay so if you write it out pointwise \emph{super} explicitly, you end up pairwise getting:

\[
\frac{(\Delta[m] \times X_{[m]} \coprod \Delta[n] \times X_{[n]})([n])}{\langle f_{\ast}([m] \xrightarrow{\tau} [n]) \times x \sim [m] \xrightarrow{\tau} [n] \times f^{\ast}(x) \rangle}
\]

Now notice any time I need to pick out an n-simplex from this huge coend, any n-simplex in some associated \(\Delta[m] \times X_{[m]}\) it is of the form \([m] \xrightarrow{\tau}[n] \times x = \tau_{\ast}([m] \xrightarrow{id} [m])\) and so you can hop the \(\tau\) over to pull back to some simplex of the form \(id \times \text{some guy in }X_{[n]}\). So it's the diagonal, and life makes sense; the morphisms work fairly obviously, just write it out. 
\item Colimit of two sided bar construction is functor tensor
\label{sec:org75f2f11}
Note that in the coequalizer below all n-simplices collapse:

\begin{tikzcd}
{\coprod_{f:[n]^{op} \to [m]^{op}} \left(\coprod_{\vec{d}: [n] \to \mathcal{D}} Gd_{n} \otimes Fd_{0}\right)} \arrow[rr, "f", shift left] \arrow[rr, "fold"', shift right] &  & {{\coprod_{n} \left(\coprod_{\vec{d}: [n] \to \mathcal{D}} Gd_{n} \otimes Fd_{0}\right)}}
\end{tikzcd}

And so you're only left with tensors indexed over total composites \(f: d_{n} \to d_{0}\). Now note that your quotient looks something like

\[
\frac{\coprod_{f:d_{0} \to d_{n}} Gd_{n} \otimes Fd_{0}}{\langle x \sim (Gf \otimes Id)(x) \sim (Id \otimes Ff)(x) \mid x \in Gd_{n}\otimes Fd_{0}\rangle}
\]

Note that this accounts for everything, because all the other identifications that result from diagrams like 

\begin{tikzcd}
Gd_{n} \otimes Fd_{0} \arrow[rr, "Gf \otimes Id"] \arrow[d, "Id"] &  & Gd_{n-1} \otimes Fd_0 \\
Gd_n \otimes Fd_0                                                 &  &                      
\end{tikzcd}

For some \(f:d_{n} \to d_{n-1}\) resulting from an inner horn composition just give you back \(Gd_{n-1}\otimes Fd_{0}\); ultimately you only really run into weird things at the degenerate 1-simplex level, which are the identifications accounted for above. Hopefully this convinces you that this is not, in fact, bullshit.

The interesting thing about this is that just taking a big colimit isn't exactly what you want here, because you've got a functor tensor product but it isn't accounting for all the big zigzaggy weirdness? So you fatten it up with these simplices to remember stuff? This'll probably get touched on in a bit.

\end{enumerate}
