1. Some notable obstacles I overcame: debugging the flip function. Initially I swapped i and n-i for the entire list,
not realising that what I'd effectively told the program to flip it twice. It took me a while to debug, but I
succeeded eventually.

2. Any arbitrary set of strings should work and build fine under the program as it currently runs. I used seven or
eight randomly generated arrays and manually created repeats where required.
