\begin{exercise}
  Let R be the ring of $\mathbb{Z}$-module endomorphisms of M $= \bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{N}}\mathbb{Z}$. Show that $R \cong R^{n}$ as R-modules.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
  We have that $\bigoplus_{i\in \mathbb{N}}\mathbb{Z} = (\bigoplus_{i\in \mathbb{N}}\mathbb{Z})  \oplus (\bigoplus_{i\in \mathbb{N}}\mathbb{Z})$ by dividing along even and odd indices. $R = \Hom_{\mathbb{Z}}(M, M) \ \cong \ \Hom_{\mathbb{Z}}(M, M \oplus M) \cong \Hom_{\mathbb{Z}}(M,M) \oplus \Hom_{\mathbb{Z}}(M,M)$. We have that $R$ is an $R$-module over itself under left translation, which corresponds to composition in the endomorphism ring. As direct sums decompose over this operation as well, we have that $R \cong R^{2}$ as $R$-modules. Proceeding recursively for each summand yields the result.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
  Let $\alpha = \sqrt{\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{5}}$.\\
  a. Find $[\mathbb{Q}(\alpha):\mathbb{Q}]$.\\
  b. What are the conjugates of $\alpha$ over $\mathbb{Q}$?
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
  We have that $\alpha^{2} = \sqrt{3}+\sqrt{5}$. This yields the following chain of simplifications:
  \begin{align*}
    &(\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{5})^{2} = 3 + \sqrt{3}\cdot\sqrt{5} + 5 \\
    & \rightarrow \text{Ans} - 8 = \sqrt{3}\cdot\sqrt{5}  \implies  \text{Ans}\cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{3}} \in \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)\\
    & \rightarrow \text{Ans} \cdot \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5} = \sqrt{5} + \frac{5}{\sqrt{3}} \implies \text{Ans} - \sqrt{3}-\sqrt{5} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \in \mathbb{Q}(\alpha) \\
    & \implies \sqrt{3}\text{ and thus }\sqrt{5} \in \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)
  \end{align*}
  Thus, $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}) \subset \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$, and we know $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}):\mathbb{Q}] = 2$. The minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5})$ is $t^{2} - \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{5}$, and it must satisfy this identity over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5})$, containing them as subfields. We thus can extend this embedding of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5})$ to one of the root of that minimal polynomial, yielding that the degree is 8 over $\mathbb{Q}$. For each conjugate of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5})$ we have different distinct roots that $\alpha$ is sent to as algebraic extension over the image of the minimal polynomials under each conjugates of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5})$. We thus have 8 conjugates, given by:
  \[
    \alpha = \pm \sqrt{\pm \sqrt{3} + \pm \sqrt{5}}
     \]
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
  Show that $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}, \sqrt{7}, \sqrt{11},...)$ is an algebraic extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ of infinite degree.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
  Any element in $K$ is a finite sum of some $a_{0} + a_{i_{1}}\sqrt{p_{i_{1}}} + ... + a_{i_{n}}\sqrt{p_{i_{n}}} + e$ where $e$ is some combination of products of the same, and thus lies in the subfield $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p_{i_{1}}},...,\sqrt{p_{i_{n}}})$, which is clearly a finite degree extension, and thus is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$; thus, $K$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$. Finally, assume that $\mathscr{B} = \{\sqrt{p_{1}},...,\sqrt{p_{n}}, (\sqrt{p_{i}}\cdot \sqrt{p_{j}})_{i \neq j},...,(\sqrt{p_{1}}...\sqrt{p_{n}} \}$ are linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$. Suppose $\sqrt{p_{n+1}} = a_{0} + \sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}\sqrt{p_{i}} + \sum_{i \neq j}a_{ij}\sqrt{p_{i}}\sqrt{p_{j}}$ for not all $a_{i\neq 0} = 0$. Then we have $p_{n+1} = \big(a_{0} + \sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}\sqrt{p_{i}} + ... + a_{1...n}(\sqrt{p_{1}}...\sqrt{p_{n}})\big)^{2}$ which is another linear combination in $\mathscr{B}$ above where not all coefficients are zero, and furthermore that at least one nonconstant coefficient in the new linear combination is nonzero. However, subtracting $p_{n+1}$ from both sides yields another linear combination in $\mathscr{B}$ that is equal to zero, and thus all coefficients must be equal to zero by linear independence. This yields a contradiction, and thus $\sqrt{p_{n+1}} \nin \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p_{1}},...,\sqrt{p_{n}})$. By induction on $n$, this yields algebraic extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ of arbitrarily large degree in $K$, and thus $K$ is of infinite degree. 
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
  a. Find the degree of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}, \sqrt[6]{2})$ \\
  b. How many embeddings of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2})$ into $\mathbb{R}$ are there? \\
  c. How many extensions of each of the embeddings in part b to an embedding of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}, \sqrt[6]{2})$are there? To what value does each send $\sqrt[6]{6}$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
  a. The degree of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2})$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is 4. We have that $\sqrt[6]{2}$ is a solution to the polynomial $t^{3} - \sqrt{2}$ in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2})[t]$, which is irreducible as it does not have a root in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2})$. Thus, $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}, \sqrt[6]{2})$ is of degree $4 \cdot 3 = 12$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. \\
  b. Any embedding of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2})$ into $\mathbb{R}$ is the identity on $\mathbb{Q}$ as 1 goes to 1, and thus is completely determined by the embedding of $\sqrt[4]{2}$. By linearity, any image of $\sqrt[4]{2}$ must be a root of the polynomial $t^{4} - 2$, for which only two roots lie in $\mathbb{R}$, $\pm \sqrt[4]{2}$. Thus, there are only two embeddings of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2})$ into $\mathbb{R}$. \\
c. Any embedding of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2})$ into $\mathbb{R}$ send $(\sqrt[4]{2})^{2}$ to $\sqrt{2}$, implying that any extension of this embedding to $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}, \sqrt[6]{2})$ must send $\sqrt[6]{2}$ to a root of the minimal polynomial $t^{3} - \sqrt{2}$ as this is the image of the minimal polynomial of $\sqrt[6]{2}$ under the embedding of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2})$ into $\mathbb{R}$. However, the only root of this polynomial that lies in $\mathbb{R}$ is the positive $\sqrt[6]{2}$, and thus we have one unique extension for each embedding of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2})$ that sends $\sqrt[6]{2}$ to the positive $\sqrt[6]{2}\in \mathbb{R}$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
  Let $\zeta_{p}$ be a primitive $p$th root of unity for $p = 2^{2^{n}}+1$ a Fermat prime. Find the degree $[\mathbb{F}_{2}(\zeta_{p}):\mathbb{F}_{2}]$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
  We have that the degree of this extension is equal to the order of 2 in $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$. We may start by considering $2^{2^{n}} = p-1$. Clearly, the order of $2$ is greater than $2^{2^{n}}$. We have that $2^{m+2^{n}}\equiv -2^{m} \mod p$ simply by this fact. Thus, it is immediate that $2^{2^{n}+2^{n}} = 2^{2^{n+1}} \equiv -2^{2^{n}} \mod p \equiv 1 \mod p$, and for all values $2^{n}< m <2^{n+1}$ we have that $2^{m+2^{n}} \equiv -2^{m} mod p$, the least positive representative of which is always greater than 1 in the ordering of $\mathbb{Z}$ unless $m = 2^{n}$. Thus, the order of $2$ is $2^{n+1}$ and the degree $[\mathbb{F}_{2}(\zeta_{p}): \mathbb{F}_{2}] = 2^{n+1}$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
  Determine the number of irreducible polynomials of degree n in $\mathbb{F}_{p}[x]$ for n a positive integer, p a prime. 
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
  In a field of characteristic $p$ we have that for any polynomial $g$, $g(t^{p}) = g(t)^{p}$. Thus, given an irreducible polynomial $g$ of degree $n$, we have that for $x$ a root of $g$, $g(x)^{p} = g(x^{p}) = 0$ and thus $x^{p}$ is also a root of $g$. Suppose $x^{p^{m}} = x$ for some $m \leq n$. Then we have that $x$ is a $(p^{m}-1)$th root of unity, all of which live in the splitting field of $t^{p^{m}}-t$, an extension field of degree $m$. This implies that the minimal polynomial of $x$ is of degree $m$, and thus $m = n$. Thus, we have that all the roots of $g$ are the distinct powers of $x$ ($n$ distinct powers of $p$ and thus $n$ distinct roots) with $x$ being a generator of the cyclic group $\mathbb{F}_{p^{n}}^{\times}$ (primitive $(p^{n}-1)$th root of unity). This multiplicative group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/(p^{r}-1)\mathbb{Z}$ as the multiplicative group of a finite field is cyclic. We have that the primitive roots of unity are the generators of this cyclic group, given by elements of $(\mathbb{Z}/(p^{r}-1)\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$. We know that if $x \in (\mathbb{Z}/(p^{r}-1)\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ then $p^{i}x \in (\mathbb{Z}/(p^{r}-1)\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ for $i = 0,..., n-1$ as $p^{n}$ is clearly coprime to $p^{n}-1$, and that $p^{n}x = x$ by assumption, as $(p^{n}-1)x = 1$. Thus $n \ | \ \varphi(p^{r}-1)$. Furthermore, for any given $x$, we have that the set $\mathfrak{R}_{x}=\{x, px,...,p^{n-1}x\}$ defines a unique irreducible polynomial from the logic above, and that $\mathfrak{R}_{x} = \mathfrak{R}_{p^{i}x}$. This defines an equivalence relation on $(\mathbb{Z}/(p^{r}-1)\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ where every partition has cardinality $n$. Thus, each partition yields a distinct irreducible polynomial (as a distinct set of $n$ roots of an irreducible polynomial of degree $n$ as all primitive $(p^{n}-1)$th roots of unity from the logic above). Thus, the number of irreducible polynomials is given by: \[\frac{|(\mathbb{Z}/(p^{r}-1)\mathbb{Z})^{\times}|}{n} = \frac{\varphi(p^{r}-1)}{n}\]
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
  Show that the algebraic closure of a countable field is countable.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
  Let $K$ be a countable field. We may compute the cardinality of the algebraic closure by first acknowledging the cardinality of the algebraic closure is the same as the cardinality of all elements that are algebraic over $K$. Any element that is algebraic over $K$ has an associated minimal polynomial that it is the solution of, which we may represent as an $n$-tuple for $n$ the degree of the algebraic element. Thus, for each natural number $n$, the number of elements algebraic over $K$ of degree $n$ is countable (number of $n$-tuples in $K$, $n$ roots per each tuple). Thus, the cardinality of the algebraic closure can be represented as:
  \[
    | \widetilde K | = \bigg|  \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\bigg(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{Q}\bigg) \bigg|
  \]
  Which is countable.
\end{proof}
